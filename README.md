# 🏦 Credit Risk Analysis

This project analyzes the behavior of past loan customers to help a financial institution assess the **credit risk** of future applicants.

By identifying patterns in **defaults** and **repayments**, the institution can make smarter, data-driven decisions when approving or denying loans.

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to study how different customer attributes influence loan repayment or default behavior.

Example questions explored in this analysis:
- Are customers from certain locations more likely to default?
- Do age groups differ in their repayment patterns?
- Does education level affect the likelihood of default?
- Are certain occupations riskier than others?
- Are higher loan amounts correlated with better or worse repayment?

By answering these questions, we help the business understand **risk profiles** and reduce future loan defaults.
